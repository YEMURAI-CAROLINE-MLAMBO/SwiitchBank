## Installation & Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase CLI tools
- Marqeta developer account (for card processing)
- Gemini API credentials (for AI services)

### Environment variables
Create a `.env` in each package (backend, functions, frontend as needed). Use `.env.example` (do not commit secrets). Example keys:
- PORT=3000
- NODE_ENV=development
- DATABASE_URL=<your-db-url>
- JWT_SECRET=<secret>
- FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_firebase_api_key>
- FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<your_project>.firebaseapp.com
- FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<your_firebase_project_id>
- FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<firebase_private_key_json_or_base64>
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<stripe_secret>
- MAILER_HOST, MAILER_USER, MAILER_PASS

### Quick start (local dev)

1.  **Clone repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YEMURAI-CAROLINE-MLAMBO/SwiitchBank.git
    cd SwiitchBank
    ```

2.  **Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Firebase functions (emulator)**
    ```bash
    cd ../functions
    cp .env.example .env
    npm install
    firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth
    ```

## Development checklist / best practices
- Add ESLint + Prettier and shared config for consistent formatting
- Add commit hooks with Husky + lint-staged to lint & format staged files
- Add unit tests and integration tests for critical flows (auth, payments, transfers)
- Validate env variables on startup with joi/convict/zod
- Centralized error handling and consistent error response format
- Avoid committing secrets â€” use GitHub Secrets for CI + Firebase environment config for deployment
- Add logging (e.g., winston or pino) and avoid console.log in production
- Add rate limiting and input validation for public endpoints
- Review firebase security rules before production deployment

## Deployment

Deploy securely using the provided script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy-secure.sh
./deploy-secure.sh
```

This deployment process includes:

Â· Cloud Function deployment
Â· Firestore rules configuration
Â· Data Connect schema implementation
Â· Security rule validation

- Use CI/CD that runs lint, tests, and build steps.
- Deploy backend to a managed host (Heroku, Render, Cloud Run) or container registry.
- Use Firebase Hosting + Functions for serverless parts if desired. Use `firebase deploy --only hosting,functions`.
- Use environment-specific Firebase project configs and secrets in CI (do not embed private keys in repo).


## Known Limitations & Issues (MVP Phase)

Â· Jools Onboarding: Business account onboarding via Jools is currently a guided assistant rather than fully autonomous implementation
Â· Currency Support: Limited to primary currency (USD) and major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH)
Â· Transaction Limits: Reduced limits during MVP testing phase
Â· Browser Support: Optimized for Chrome and Safari browsers
