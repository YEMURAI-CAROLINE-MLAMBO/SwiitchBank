### ðŸ’¸ Financial Calculators

As part of our commitment to financial intelligence, SwitchBank includes a suite of powerful backend calculators. The first available tool is the **Debt Repayment Optimizer**.

#### Debt Repayment Optimizer

This tool, located in the `OptimizationEngine`, provides two industry-standard strategies for paying off multiple debts:

-   **Debt Snowball**: This method focuses on paying off the smallest debts first to build psychological momentum.
-   **Debt Avalanche**: This method focuses on paying off the debts with the highest interest rates first to minimize the total interest paid over the life of the loans.

These calculators can be used to provide users with a clear, actionable plan to become debt-free.

### ðŸš€ Advanced Financial Modeling Engine

To transform SwitchBank from a simple tracking app into a sophisticated financial planning platform, we've integrated a powerful new financial modeling engine. This engine provides the mathematical foundation for truly intelligent financial advice, turning our Sophia AI into a quantitative expert.

**Core Models:**
-   **FinancialModel**: Handles personal financial statement modeling (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), DCF valuation, and sensitivity analysis.
-   **MonteCarloEngine**: Powers probability-based simulations for retirement planning, real estate investment, and business valuation.
-   **RiskModel**: Assesses portfolio risk (VaR, Expected Shortfall), credit risk, and liquidity risk.
-   **BehavioralModel**: Models user spending and investment behavior to identify patterns and biases.
-   **ScenarioEngine**: Conducts comprehensive "what-if" analysis for various financial scenarios (e.g., market crashes, recessions).
-   **SophiaModeling**: Integrates all models to create personalized, dynamic financial plans for users.
-   **LiveModeling**: Allows for real-time model updates with new data and generates predictive alerts.

#### Financial Modeling Applications

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous Communication System

SwiitchBank features a sophisticated, autonomous communication system to handle all user and developer notifications. This system operates with zero required human intervention, ensuring timely, relevant, and personalized communication.

The system is built around a `CoreCommunication` engine that manages two primary channels: **Email** and **In-App Messaging**.

#### Key Capabilities:

-   **Automated Message Triggers**: The system automatically sends messages based on user behavior and system events.
    -   **Welcome Sequence**: New users receive a welcome message and a follow-up to guide them through onboarding.
    -   **Security Alerts**: High-priority security events (e.g., suspicious logins) instantly trigger alerts to the user's email and in-app inbox.
    -   **Weekly Financial Insights**: Jools AI generates and sends a personalized financial summary to each active user every week.

-   **Dual-Channel Delivery**:
    -   **In-App Messaging**: All notifications are delivered as in-app messages, accessible through a dedicated message center. A real-time notification badge with an unread count keeps users informed.
    -   **Email Notifications**: Critical messages, such as security alerts and high-priority financial updates, are also sent via email to ensure they are not missed.

-   **Developer & System Notifications**:
    -   The system keeps the development team informed about its operational status.
    -   **System Health Alerts**: Important events, like system startup or critical errors, trigger an email notification to a designated developer address (`ymlamo21@gmail.com`).
    -   **High-Priority CC**: The developer email is automatically CC'd on high-priority user communications, like security alerts, for oversight.

-   **Intelligent Scheduling & Prioritization**: The system uses a priority system (`high`, `medium`, `low`) and message type (`security`, `financial`, `system`) to determine the appropriate communication channel and timing, preventing user spam.

## Installation & Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase CLI tools
- Flutter SDK

### Environment Variables Setup
This project uses `.env` files for managing environment variables for local development. A master template, `.env.example`, is provided in the root directory. For local development, you should create a `.env` file inside each package (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `functions/`) that requires it. **Do not commit `.env` files.**

**Example for the backend:**
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2. Copy the `.env.example` file: `cp ../.env.example .env`
3. Fill in the required secrets in the new `backend/.env` file.

For the Flutter app, environment variables are passed in at compile time by the build script.

### Quick start (local dev)

1.  **Clone repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YEMURAI-CAROLINE-MLAMBO/SwiitchBank.git
    cd SwiitchBank
    ```

2.  **Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Create .env from .env.example and fill in secrets
    cp ../.env.example .env
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    # Create .env from .env.example and fill in secrets
    cp ../.env.example .env
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Firebase functions (emulator)**
    ```bash
    cd ../functions
    # Create .env from .env.example and fill in secrets
    cp ../.env.example .env
    npm install
    firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore,auth
    ```
5.  **Flutter (Mobile)**
    For local development, you can run the app with a specific API endpoint like this:
    ```bash
    flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
    ```

## Building the Flutter App for an Environment
The `build_for_environment.sh` script is used to build the Flutter web app for a specific environment. This script will automatically select the correct API_BASE_URL.

**Usage:**
```bash
# To build for development (default)
./build_for_environment.sh

# To build for staging
./build_for_environment.sh staging

# To build for production
./build_for_environment.sh production
```
