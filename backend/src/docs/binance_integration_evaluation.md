# Binance Integration Evaluation

This document outlines the evaluation of integrating the Binance API into our platform.

## 1. Binance API Features

We will evaluate the following Binance API features:

- **Exchange Rate API:** To get real-time exchange rates for various cryptocurrency pairs.
- **Order Creation API:** To programmatically create buy/sell orders.
- **Wallet API:** To manage user wallets and balances.

## 2. Technical Feasibility

- **API Key Management:** We will need to securely store and manage Binance API keys.
- **Rate Limiting:** We need to be mindful of Binance's API rate limits to avoid being blocked.
- **Error Handling:** We need to implement robust error handling for API calls.

## 3. Security Considerations

- **API Key Security:** API keys must be stored securely and not exposed on the client-side.
- **Transaction Security:** All transactions will be conducted over a secure connection (HTTPS).
- **Data Privacy:** We will only request the minimum necessary permissions for our API keys.

## 4. Next Steps

- [ ] Obtain Binance API keys for the sandbox environment.
- [ ] Implement a test service to interact with the Binance API.
- [ ] Write a report summarizing the findings of the evaluation.
