## Introduction

This document outlines potential Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks and compliant cryptocurrency exchanges that could be integrated with the platform to facilitate crypto-to-bank payouts. The goal is to identify reliable and efficient partners that can provide competitive rates and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Factors to Consider

When evaluating potential integration partners, the following factors should be considered:

- **Supported Cryptocurrencies:** Which cryptocurrencies can be traded and settled?
- **Fees and Spreads:** What are the transaction fees, withdrawal fees, and exchange spreads?
- **API Capabilities:** Is there a robust and well-documented API for programmatic access and integration?
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Are they licensed and compliant with relevant financial regulations in target jurisdictions (KYC, AML)?
- **Liquidity:** Do they have sufficient liquidity to handle the expected transaction volumes?
- **Settlement Speed and Methods:** How quickly are fiat payouts processed, and what methods are available (e.g., bank transfer, other payment networks)?
- **Geographical Coverage:** In which regions do they operate and offer services?
- **Customer Support:** What is the quality and responsiveness of their support?
- **Reputation and Security:** Do they have a strong track record and robust security measures?
