# Backend API Configuration

# The base URL of your backend API.
# For local development, this will typically be on localhost.
# In production, this will be your deployed backend URL.
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# It's recommended to use a separate API key for the frontend if needed,
# for example, for a service like Google Maps.
# For now, we will leave this empty as it's not immediately required.
